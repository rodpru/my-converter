      question: "What's in the pro version?",
      answer:
        'Pro adds one-click deploys, a CLI tool, advanced auth (roles & invites), automated emails, analytics hooks, lifetime updates, and priority support — built for founders who want to launch fast.',

      question: "Do I lose access to the free version if I don't upgrade?",

        'Nope. The free version stays open source and always available. Pro just saves you time and setup pain.',

        'Open an issue on GitHub or drop it in the Discord — we fix bugs fast, and pro users get priority patches + updates.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I upgrade later?',
      answer:
        "Absolutely. You can start free, and when you're ready to go pro, your setup stays compatible.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How often do you ship updates?',
      answer:
        'Bug fixes and small updates drop regularly; pro users get early access to new templates and features.',

      question: 'What support does pro include?',
      answer:
        "Private Discord, priority replies, and lifetime updates. You'll never be stuck figuring things out alone.",
